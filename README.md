For the course of Interactive Programming in Python on Coursera

I'm sorry that I posted a link to github but not codeskulptor as I am in China and codeskulptor can not work well here due to the Great Firewall of Chinese government. For the previous assignments, I managed to get the access to codeskulptor via VPN through Spotflux. But this time when I finished my code and tried to save my scripts in codeskulptor, it somehow did not allow me to do it. I have no where to go only to save my scripts in Github. I hope you could understand the situation and I'm sorry for the inconvenience due to the issue.
